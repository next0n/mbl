MBL - Minimal Boot Loader for 80C188EB project board
Arto Merilainen, arto.merilainen@gmail.com

This repository includes a small bootloader for 80C188EB CPU. The
bootloader simply sets up UART, loads an application and starts
execution of the just loaded application.

The code in this repository is intended to be a demonstration how
the CPU can be initialized and there is no guarantee that it will
work in the configuration you have.

Code was written in 2005 and I've tried to keep most of the code
intact to reduce possibility of accidentally breaking it (I just
translated my comments in Finnish to English).

In case you think you have found a bug, please drop me an email.


You can compile the bootloader using nasm:

  nasm bootldr.asm -o bootldr.bin
